      <h1>Why Epicodus</h1>
      <p>I recently moved to Portland, Oregon from West Virginia to pursue a career in computer programming. It was a big decision, but something I feel good about. In high school, I loved programming. My computer science course was awesome, and I even developed videogames in my spare time using actionscript 2.0. (<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/swervmerv/mikey-rpg">Click here to play Mikey RPG!</a> It's not that great.) I went to college a CS major, but quickly realized that my small liberal arts college had little to offer in that department. Instead, I studied English:Writing with the dream of becoming a professional author. I guess I'm technically an author because I wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warscapia-Garrett-Boggs-ebook/dp/B01J4IORWU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470414504&sr=8-1&keywords=warscapia">book about a video universe</a> and got a  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warscapia-Garrett-Boggs-ebook/dp/B01J4IORWU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470414504&sr=8-1&keywords=warscapia">short story</a> published in a literay magazine, but I  realized that there a very small market in writing, and decided that I needed a marketable skill! Thus, I decided on programming!

      <h1>Hobbies and interests</h1>
      <p> I was a distance runner in high school/college. My senior year in high school I ran a 4:28 mile, then four years later I placed tenth all time at Wheaton college with a 9:30 3k steeple. I now want to train for a 50k trail race! I won a 25k race back in West Virginia, but I'm really wanting to push myself to new limits! Plus, Oregon is super hipster and trail racing is cool here. I'm also into rock climbing and mountain biking.</p>
