  <h1>Why Epicodus</h1>
    <p>I recently moved to Portland, Oregon from West Virginia to pursue a career in computer programming. It was a big decision, but something I feel good about. In high school, I loved programming. My computer science course was awesome, and I even developed videogames in my spare time using actionscript 2.0. (<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/swervmerv/mikey-rpg">Click here to play Mikey RPG!</a> It's not that great.) I went to college a CS major, but quickly realized that my small liberal arts college had little to offer in that department. Instead, I studied English with the dream of becoming a professional author. I guess I'm technically an author because I wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warscapia-Garrett-Boggs-ebook/dp/B01J4IORWU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470414504&sr=8-1&keywords=warscapia">book about a video universe</a> and got a  <a href="http://friggmagazine.com/issuefortyseven/splashpages/GarrettBoggs.htm">short story</a> published in a literay magazine, but I  realized that there is a very small market in writing, and decided that I needed a marketable skill! Thus, I decided on programming!

    <h1>Hobbies and interests</h1>
    <p> I really like running! I'm training for a <span class="red">50k</span> trail race! In my spare time, I also play video games and lift weights! My favorite drink is Red Bull, and my favorite author is probably John Steinbeck. I'm really interested in the integration between literature and video games.</p>
